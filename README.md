# DSA210_project
# Motivation
My motivation on this project was to understand the relationship between my physical activity (step counts) and sedentory behaviour (time spent on netflix). I chose this topic because it can provide valuable insights into my lifestyle. By analyzing these patterns, I hope to identify areas for improvement, achieve a better balance between activity and relaxation, and make informed decisions to enhance my health and overall well-being.
