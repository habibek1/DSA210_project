This is my Data Science project that analyzes the relationship between my daily step counts and the time I spend watching Netflix. Using data collection and visualization techniques, I aim to uncover patterns and identify trends that can provide insights into my lifestyle.

# Motivation
My motivation on this project was to understand the relationship between my physical activity (step counts) and sedentory behaviour (time spent on netflix). I chose this topic because it can provide valuable insights into my lifestyle. By analyzing these patterns, I hope to identify areas for improvement, achieve a better balance between activity and relaxation, and make informed decisions to enhance my health and overall well-being.

# Data Source
I retrieved my daily step counts data using the Health app in my iphone. In order to get data that shows the time spend on Netflix, I demanded and downloaded my own data from Netflix.
