This is my data science project that analyzes the relationship between my daily step counts and the time I spend watching Netflix. Using data collection and visualization techniques, I aim to uncover patterns and identify trends that can provide insights into my lifestyle.

# Motivation
My motivation on this project was to understand the relationship between my physical activity (step counts) and sedentory behaviour (time spent on netflix). I chose this topic because it can provide valuable insights into my lifestyle. By analyzing these patterns, I hope to identify areas for improvement, achieve a better balance between activity and relaxation, and make informed decisions to enhance my health and overall well-being.

# Data Source
I retrieved my daily step counts data using the Health app in my iphone. In order to get data that shows the time spend on Netflix, I demanded and downloaded my own data from Netflix. Then, I processed my raw data in order to eliminate unnecessary part and to preserve other users' privacy.

# Data Analysis
In my analysis of datasets, I focused on examining the relationship between my daily Netflix viewing duration and step counts from January to November 2024. I employed statistical methods to understand the correlation between these variables, including both Pearson and Spearman correlations to capture both linear and non-linear relationships. The analysis covered daily patterns across different time periods, with visualizations available showing the trends through scatter plots, time series, bar plots and kernel density estimation plots.For the data analysis and graphs see my powerpoint file.

# Findings
Through my analysis, I discovered interesting patterns in the relationship between my Netflix viewing habits and daily step counts. The Spearman correlation (-0.1527, p=0.0386) revealed a statistically significant negative relationship, suggesting that higher Netflix viewing times tend to correspond with lower step counts, although this relationship is relatively weak. The data showed considerable variation in both activities, with daily steps ranging from 33 to 24,489 and Netflix viewing time varying from less than a minute to over 5 hours per day. On average, I watched about 68 minutes of Netflix daily and took approximately 3,776 steps.
The statistical analysis revealed that while there is a negative correlation between Netflix viewing and steps, this relationship explains only about 1.2% of the variance in the data. This suggests that while there is a tendency for higher Netflix viewing to correspond with lower step counts, many other factors likely influence both behaviors. The fact that the Spearman correlation was significant while the Pearson correlation wasn't (-0.1073, p=0.1473) indicates that the relationship between these variables isn't strictly linear but follows a more complex pattern.

# Limitations and Future Work
Several limitations exist in my current analysis. Firstly, the step count data doesn't capture other forms of physical activity I might engage in, and the Netflix viewing time doesn't account for other forms of screen time or sedentary activities. For future work, I plan to expand this analysis in several ways. I would like to include data from other streaming platforms to get a more complete picture of my viewing habits. Additionally, incorporating factors like weather data, work/study schedules, and different types of content watched could provide more context for understanding these patterns.
